# examplegoapi
demo api in Go

This app is a simple demo app for learning go in the context of writing an api. I'll be updating it over time to (hopefully)
professional standard code.

It will cover themes like:
Routing
Bearer Authorization with Jwt middleware
Middleware
Controllers
DB Access and query definitions
RequestContext
Configuration (with secrets file)
Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifest for uploading to K8s cluster
